# Assignment Description
This project is a responsive web application built using React, Recharts, Tailwind CSS, and Chakra UI. The application features a clean and organized UI layout:

## Left Sidebar: Contains a navigation bar with important links.
## Center Section: Features two main components:
## Important Links: A section with key links for user navigation.
## Monthly Spend Bar Chart: A bar chart visualizing monthly expenditure data over the past year, utilizing Recharts for dynamic data representation.
## Right Section: Displays detailed information about trading accounts and open trades.
The application is designed to be fully responsive. On medium screens, the sidebar collapses into a hamburger menu for a streamlined view. Additionally, on smaller screens, the right section (showing trading accounts and open trades) adjusts its position to display below the chart for improved readability.
